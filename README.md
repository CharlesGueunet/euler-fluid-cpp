This project is based upon the article by Mike Ash.

This Project is a visualisation of Euler's famous Navier Stokes Equations.

Simplified this project is a grid based simulation that emulates and visualizes how fluids act, as well as how their behaviour changes if you change the viscosity, or diffusion of a certain liquid.
