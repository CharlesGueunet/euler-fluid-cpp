## Inspiration

This project is based upon an article by Mike Ash.

For more info see: https://mikeash.com/pyblog/fluid-simulation-for-dummies.html

## What is it?

This Project is a visualisation of Euler's famous `Navier Stokes Equations`.

Simplified this project is a grid based simulation that emulates and visualizes how fluids act, as well as how their behaviour changes if you change the `viscosity` or `diffusion` of a certain liquid.

If you have any `improvements` or `ideas`, please let me know.

Also feel free to report any bugs that may occur.
